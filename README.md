#React-Alot

A Meteor/React demo project, started with investigating React

- Got routing to work
- Got some basic components
- Introduced Material UI stuff

##Routing example

If you click on "Repos" in the menu, you will see a bulleted list appear, with 

* React Router
* React

Click either of these to see sub-routes in action. Check the URL, and you will see that information from the URL appears on screen - basically these are route parameters

##To do
* Get login button to work
* Get rid of old bootstrap code for editing carrots (even though rendered obsolete by the drop in grid, it may be worth keeping)
